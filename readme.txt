This is for elaboration on the large file submission of Mark Tyler's dissertation work.

In this file I have provided:

1. The script developed for the project and written about in the dissertation (crowdsrc-adhoc.cc).

2. Additional files, which contains the Wireshark trace files of the simulated nodes, and the xml
file for the Netanim animation. This isn't useful without the NetAnim software, however...

3. The Xubuntu-ContikiNG-NS3 folder contains a copy of the Virtual Machine used to develop the script,
which was suspended just after the dissertation work was submitted and contains the script open on
Visual Studio Code, the NetAnim software loaded with the animation, and Wireshark loaded with one of the
trace files. The virtual machine used was VMWare Workstation. If this method of submission does not work,
I endeavour to present these in my video presentation.

-----

EDIT

-----

I have, after writing this, since discovered that the compressed virtual machine does not fit into the
submission size limit. Therefore, I have left it out of the submission and will hope to fill in the gaps
with my video presentation. 

Please contact me for any elaboration if this does not work:
